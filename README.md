# Hemanth Token Contract

This repository contains the Solidity code for the Hemanth ERC20 token. The token is implemented using the OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract and has an initial supply of 1000 tokens minted to the deployer's address.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you deploy and interact with the Hemanth token contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local development machine:

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Truffle or Hardhat (Ethereum development environments)
- MetaMask (for interacting with the contract)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    

2. **Install dependencies**:
    

3. **Compile the contract** (using Truffle or Hardhat):
   

### Deployment

1. **Deploy the contract** (using Truffle):
    

    Ensure you configure your network settings in the `truffle-config.js` or `hardhat.config.js` file.

### Interacting with the Contract

Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using various methods. Below are some common interactions:

1. **Check the total supply**:
    

2. **Check the balance of an address**:
    

3. **Transfer tokens**:
    `

### Contract Details

- **Contract Name**: Hemanth
- **Token Symbol**: HE
- **Initial Supply**: 1000 HE (minted to the deployer's address)

### Dependencies

This project uses the OpenZeppelin library for the ERC20 implementation. You can find more information about OpenZeppelin contracts [here](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/).
