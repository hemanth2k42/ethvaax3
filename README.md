The contract owner, referred to as the "King," has the ability to mint new tokens. Token holders can also burn their own tokens and transfer tokens to other addresses.

## Features

- **Minting**: The contract owner can mint new tokens.
- **Burning**: Token holders can burn their own tokens.
- **Transferring**: Token holders can transfer tokens to other addresses.
